A simple NPC that players can pay to restore HP.

Configuration

    Custom Currency: You can set the currency used for payment.
    NPC Customization: Choose the model for the NPC.
    Dynamic Pricing: Increase the price if a related profession exists in the town. (Useful if there’s a doctor in town—set a high price to encourage players to visit the doctor instead!)
